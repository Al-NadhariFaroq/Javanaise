<h1>Javanaise</h1>

<p>This Git repository contains the source code and work done on the Javanaise project.
The work completed includes the development of Javanaise version 1 and version 2.
Additionally, the project has been extended to include features for handling local server termination and coordinator failure.
Various tests have been conducted to ensure the proper functioning of the system.</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>

<p>The following programs have been conducted to verify the functionality and performance of the Javanaise system:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>IRC:</strong> A chat application, sharing messages between processes.</li>
    <li><strong>IRC burst:</strong> A procedure that increases a string counter by one using the IRC message system. </li>
    <li><strong>Counter burst:</strong> A procedure that increases an integer counter by one.</li>
</ul>
